/**
 * @defgroup uinput uinput device creation
 *
 * Creation of uinput devices based on existing libevdev devices. These functions
 * help to create uinput devices that emulate libevdev devices. In the simplest
 * form it serves to duplicate an existing device:
 *
 * @code
 * int err;
 * int new_fd;
 * struct libevdev *dev, new_dev;
 * struct libevdev_uinput *uidev;
 *
 * const char *syspath;
 *
 * err = libevdev_new_from_fd(&dev, fd);
 * if (err != 0)
 *	return err;
 *
 * uifd = open("/dev/uinput", O_RDWR);
 * if (uidev < 0)
 *	return -errno;
 *
 * err = libevdev_uinput_create_from_device(dev, uifd, &uidev);
 * if (err != 0)
 *	return err;
 *
 * syspath = libevdev_uinput_get_syspath(uidev);
 *
 * ... see libevdev_uinput_get_syspath() for information on
 *     how to get the devnode ...
 *
 * new_fd = open(devnode, O_RDONLY);
 * if (new_fd < 0)
 *	return -errno;
 *
 * err = libevdev_new_from_fd(&new_dev, new_fd);
 * if (err != 0)
 *	return err;
 *
 * ... do something ...
 *
 * libevdev_free(new_dev);
 * libevdev_uinput_destroy(uidev);
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * Alternatively, a device can be constructed from scratch:
 *
 * @code
 * int err;
 * struct libevdev *dev;
 * struct libevdev_uinput *uidev;
 *
 * dev = libevdev_new();
 * libevdev_set_name(dev, "test device");
 * libevdev_enable_event_type(dev, EV_REL);
 * libevdev_enable_event_code(dev, EV_REL, REL_X);
 * libevdev_enable_event_code(dev, EV_REL, REL_Y);
 * libevdev_enable_event_type(dev, EV_KEY);
 * libevdev_enable_event_code(dev, EV_KEY, BTN_LEFT);
 * libevdev_enable_event_code(dev, EV_KEY, BTN_MIDDLE);
 * libevdev_enable_event_code(dev, EV_KEY, BTN_RIGHT);
 *
 * uifd = open("/dev/uinput", O_RDWR);
 * if (uidev < 0)
 *	return -errno;
 *
 * err = libevdev_uinput_create_from_device(dev, uifd, &uidev);
 * if (err != 0)
 *	return err;
 *
 * ... do something ...
 *
 * libevdev_free(new_dev);
 * libevdev_uinput_destroy(uidev);
